Peek
============

Peek is a system of creating augmented reality content using the [Unity3D Game Engine](http://unity3d.com). Check it out on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/andybiar/peek).

Peek consists of several components, one of which is the RGBDShader, a Unity shader designed to render 3D models from image files. The [RGBD Toolkit](http://rgbdtoolkit.com) can export image files of the correct format, allowing you a complete workflow from filming animations with the Kinect to rendering them in Unity.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The RGBDShader is written in GLSL, so it only works on Macs at this time.

To see the shader in action, open the Unity Example Project in Unity, double click on the Peek_demo scene in the Assets folder, and press play!

In the coming months I will publish a more thorough tutorial, but if you are interested in using Peek or collaborating, please feel free to contact me on Twitter @andybiar.
