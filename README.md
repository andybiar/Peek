Peek
============

Peek is a system of creating and deploying augmented reality content using the [Unity3D Game Engine](http://unity3d.com). This repository is home to all things Peek for the forseeable future. Check out Peek in action on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/andybiar/peek).

##Example Unity Project

The example Unity Project is a means of demonstrating and playing with the RGBDShader, a Unity shader designed to render 3D models from image frames exported from the [RGBD Toolkit](http://rgbdtoolkit.com).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The RGBDShader is written in GLSL, which means that it will only run reliably on Macs. This only affects the Unity editor, though; anything exported from a Mac Unity editor will run on any platform.

To check out the shader, clone this repo and open Unity. From Unity click File --> Open Project, and select the Example Unity Project folder from this repo. Once you've opened the project, double-click the scene file in the Assets folder to open it, press play, and enjoy!

More thorough tutorial to come.
